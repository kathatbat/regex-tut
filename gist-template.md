# Regex Tutorial

Welcome to my regex tutorial on URL validation! In this guide, I'll break down the components of a regular expression used to validate URLs. Whether you're parsing text or building a web application, understanding how to validate URLs effectively is essential.

## Summary

We'll focus on a regex pattern specifically designed to validate URLs:
/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/

This pattern allows for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, domain names with various extensions, and optional paths. Throughout this tutorial, we'll dissect each part of this regex to understand how it works.
